# Data Journal

This repository contains explanations and concepts related to data, how to summarize it, process it, understand it and build useful applications.

I have a passion for data and would like to share knowledge.

This repository will include information from various sources that I gather on my journey while learning from books, courses, podcasts, blogs, and videos.

It will be populated on the go...

I will be covering topics related to:
* Probability
* Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Data Mining
* Big Data

I will also include sample datasets and code snippets to help understand concepts.

Code will be in either R or python, and several libraries will be covered and used such as:

- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras
- R: ggplot, dplyr, prob, crayon
